# text-replacer

A simple utility site for finding-and-replacing text. Made in an afternoon to learn Javascript/Typescript.

## Usage

Fill in the form with the text you want to alter, the text you want to search, and the text you want to replace it with.

## Contributing

The code here is probably not very good. If there's a way I can improve it, please let me know and I will look into it.

If you want to actually make changes to the code, do it to [`script.ts`](./script.ts), not `script.js`.
